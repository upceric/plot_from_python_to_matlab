# plot_from_python_to_matlab
using python to generate a matlab file for plotting.
what don't we directly use python for plotting?
There are some reasons...\\
detail_plot.py is the file for generating the m file
ave_o_N.m is the file to make an average of a data set
distinguishable_colors.m is the file for beautifully plot line
